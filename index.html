        <div class="subheading mb-5">MarketingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside in my first year. I am majoring in Pre-business, but I intend on concentrating in Marketing.  I currently have a 3.8 GPA and work part-time on top of my academics. I am currently in Girl Gains, a club to encourage girls to work out. I have also participated in volunteering activities with Mujeres Unidas here on campus. As for my work experience, I was a volunteer at a non-profit organization called Science Gurus from September 2019 until January 2020. In this role, I co-taught science concepts to young students and hosted the class once per week. During high school, I balanced a full-academic schedule with volunteering. I handled customer service and inquiries as well. Later, I founded my own class in the organization. From July 2020 until May 2021, I devised lesson plans and homework. Also, I directed virtual classes once a week. I instructed 50+ students and designed a Google Classroom with nine months of teaching content. I also marketed the class to potential students and other guests. Afterwards, I created a video game design internship opportunity for my fellow high school students. I marketed the internship through various platforms such as Instagram, NextDoor, and local schools. I handled customer service. Also, I attained a recognition for teaching from Science Gurus. Apart from internships, I also worked at 99% Tea House from October 2021 until August 2022. During my position as a barista, I collaborated with coworkers to efficiently prepare beverages and food. I trained in customer service to create a welcoming atmosphere. I balanced a part-time schedule with a full-time academic schedule. I averaged a 15 hour / week time commitment and photographed drinks for website marketing. Now, I have been working at Starbucks since September 2022. I was trained in customer service and averaged a 15 hour / week time commitment. I was well-trained in customer connection. 
<br><br>

       One of my hobbies includes playing the piano, which I have been playing since 2011. I played for over 9 years in various concerts and I am a level 7 student. I believe this hobby has helped me hone my creative skills, which is helpful when it comes to running marketing campaigns. I also believe it shows my commitment to honing skills and perfecting my craft, which carries over to the work that I produce. Another hobby that I enjoy is writing. I have won various awards for my essay writing, and I also believe that it helps with marketing campaigns and my creative skills. 
<br><br>

        Some awards that I have achieved the 2021 AP Scholar Award with Honors for exemplary college-level achievement. Also, I won the 2021 Mission Valley Regional Occupational Program of Achievement in Entrepreneurship for outstanding effort and completion in Entrepreneurship. Also, I was recognized for the 2021 Science Gurus Volunteer Teaching Recognition for commendable volunteering work within the non-profit organization. I am fluent in English, as a native speaker, and Hindi. I am also elementary-proficient in Spanish.
